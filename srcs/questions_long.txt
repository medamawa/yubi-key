Peace begins with a smile
You belong with me
Look what you made me do
I just wanna lay in my bed
Nothing at all
Got a long list of ex-lovers
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Put your pinky rings up to the moon!
I should have bought you flowers
You are my treasure
I'm in love with the shape of you
Darling, you look perfect tonight
I'm on my way
My bad habits lead to late nights
We keep this love in a photograph
Baby, oh!
Is it too late now to say sorry?
What do you mean?
Well, you look happy and healthy
Do you get deja vu when she is with you?
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
If you could see that I'm the one for you
When I see your face, there's nothing I'd change
Cause you make me feel like heaven's gates
Take me into your loving arms
Think different
You said forever, now I drive past streets
You betrayed me
How's the castle built off others' emotions?
Let it be
We will, we will rock you
Shake it off
All you need is love
You are the dancing queen
We're half way there
I will always love you
Cause I'm happy, clap along
Like a rolling stone
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
I wanna dance with somebody
It's my life
I just want to live while I'm alive
