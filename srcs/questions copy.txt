Peace begins with a smile
You belong with me
We are never ever getting back together
Look what you made me do
I just wanna lay in my bed
Nothing at all
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Got a long list of ex-lovers
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Cause you make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven
Put your pinky rings up to the moon!
I should have bought you flowers
You are my treasure
I'm in love with the shape of you
Darling, you look perfect tonight
I'm on my way
My bad habits lead to late nights
We keep this love in a photograph
Baby, oh!
Is it too late now to say sorry?
What do you mean?
Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Do you get deja vu when she is with you?
You betrayed me, and I know that you'll never feel sorry
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
